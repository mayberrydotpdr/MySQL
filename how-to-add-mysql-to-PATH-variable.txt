Be sure that your mysql\bin folder is part of your $PATH variable:

Go to Control Panel -> System -> Advanced
Click Environment Variables

Under System Variables find PATH and click on it.
In the Edit windows, find the end of the string of paths (each path needs to be separated by a semi-colon ";" so you may need to add that to the end) add the path to your mysql\bin folder to the end paths.

Go back to Desktop

Close any command prompts you may have open Got to do this so the new $PATH variable will load.

Re-open command prompt. Try running mysql -u root -p and if the path was set correctly, mysql will now run.

Lines to ADD to Path:

C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin 
%MYSQL_HOME%\bin
